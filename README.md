# UVa-Profilebook
Java project to keep track of UVa profiles of a list. Either UVa ID or username can be used to add a profile which can be updated or deleted later. A profile can be used to access uHunt account online.

This project was my very first ever so it's not really up to the mark, but it started with a good motivation of contributing in programming community somehow, like using such a project to keep track junior contestants and so on.


To build the project, first a database named *friendlist* should be created with Username: Zeron and Password: 123456. The database should contain a table named *FRIENDLIST* with the columns *NAME* (VARCHAR), *UVA_ID* (INTEGER, Primary), *USERNAME* (VARCHAR).
